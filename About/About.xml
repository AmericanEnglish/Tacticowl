	<description> Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.
These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod.

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependencies &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

This mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended) 
and should be compatible with existing saves. However, this is the first release, 
so I can not guarantee this. 
Please report any problems regarding mod incompatibility. 

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upcoming Features &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

I would like to implement the following features but do not promise anything. 
-Allowing the AI to make use of the Run and Gun mode. (highest priority)
-Allowing melee weapons to be used while running
