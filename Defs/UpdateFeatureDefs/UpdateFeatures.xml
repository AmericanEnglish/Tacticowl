		<content>RunAndGun has been updated with the following changes: 
- The RunAndGun movement penalty now depends on how heavy weapons are. What are considered heavy weapons and the penalty per weapon type can be configured in the mod options.

- Improved compatibility with non-human races. 
- Changed the position of the RunAndGun button.
